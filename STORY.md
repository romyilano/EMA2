# 1) Out to Dinner

Who:  Patrick, Amir, Chris, Ken
What/Where:  Dinner at Patxis
How Much: $100.00 total    
Summary:  Slycing dinner 4 ways evenly.

Pat, Amir, Chris, Ken go for dinner at Patxis and slyce the bill: $100 total with tip included.  Chris decides to pay for the full bill and get paid back by everyone. Chris opens SLYCE app, to home screen showing *overall balances* for money I’m Owed, I Owe, and detailed list view of people who make up these balances.  Chris see’s that his current overall situation displayed as the following:  

I’m Owed (Overall):  +$400.  
I'm Owed (Detail):  Amir owes me (+$100),  Ken owes me (+$100),  Patrick owes me  (+$125),  Leslie owes me (+$75)	

I Owe (Overall):  -$50.
I Owe (Detail):  Steve Jobs (-$50)

Chris presses +Add button, to add the new bill from Patxis.  
The Add Bill Screen opens.  Chris inputs information about the bill and dinner into the following fields and in this order:
1-Title/description:  Patxis Dinner
2-Amount:  $100
3-Add photo???:  picture of bill (optional)
4-Add Date??? (optional/or defaults current date)

Next Chris has to select/input people into the Who Paid field.  This field automatically is highlighted and Chris’ name/icon automatically appears inside the field.  (Note: If he was not paying, he could unselect his icon…by dragging it out or tapping himself to unselect).  Within this Who Paid field it also shows the total amount paid: $100. 

Next Chris selects people to the Who Owes field….either by dragging/or tapping on icons from horizontal scrolling Contact List.  Chris begins to select/input Patrick, Amir, and Kenny into the Who Owes Field.  The total owed for this bill is $75 ($100 – $25 Chris’share).   As he drags each person to the who owes field, the default setting is to slyce the bill evenly among each person.  Therefore, as he drags the 1st person (Patrick) to the field, Patrick is displayed as owing $75.  Next Chris selects the 2nd person (Amir), which slyces the balance in half, and shows both Patrick and Amir owing $37.50 each.  Finally Chris selects Ken to the field, slycing the bill into 3 and shows Patrick, Amir, and Ken all showing $25 each.  

Chris hits the Enter/save button, and this total bill is inputed and split evenly 4 ways (+$25 each person).  The transaction is recorded; +$25 is added to each person’s existing balance; and all totals are updated on home screen: 

I’m Owed (Overall):  +$475.
I'm Owed (Detail):  Amir owes me (+$100)(+$25 )= +125,  Ken owes me (+$100)(+25)= +125,  Patrick owes me (+$125)(+25)= +150,  
Leslie owes me (+$75)	

I Owe (Overall):  -$50.
I Owe (Detail):  Steve Jobs (-$50).

Later, Amir pays Chris $25 via Paypal.  Chris records this $25 transaction by opening to the home screen, selecting Amir’s name and then the Patxis transaction, and hitting the settle button.  $25 is subtracted from Amir balance and is now $100.
